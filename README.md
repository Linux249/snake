# snake


# ideas
- grid where a player is or not
- zoom out with higher score
- use socket.io for send updates 
-- only send changes to rhe user (not if a snake grows and her tail is stoped)
-- only send players interaktion snd let the client make busines logig
- endless map: the user doesnt see a boarder 


- player logs in before playing? facebook/oauth
- different food for the snake
- different style of the game (retro/rainbowcolor/modern)

# QUESTIONS:
- how to sync clients thats all have dame tick?
- where to set middle if the screen
- how the get synch

# TODO
- looking for oauth tutorial
